# Microcontroller-Based-IoT-Enabled-Smart-Energy-Meter
This IoT-based Smart Energy Meter uses NodeMCU (ESP8266) and PZEM-004T v3.0 to monitor voltage, current, power, energy, frequency, and power factor in real time. Data is shown on an I2C LCD and sent to ThingSpeak Cloud for remote monitoring and data visualization.
